        clothing construction and natural beauty to clothing and its
        accessories. It is influenced by culture and different trends, and has
        varied over time and place. "A fashion designer creates clothing,
        including dresses, suits, pants, and skirts, and accessories like shoes
        and handbags, for consumers. He or she can specialize in clothing,
        accessory, or jewelry design, or may work in more than one of these
        areas.
